 PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK & NEXT STEPS
 =====================

 ðŸŸ¢ What You're Doing Well:
 - You are using modular functions for rendering and updating UI.
 - You clear lists before rendering to avoid duplicates.
 - You use event listeners and arrays of objects for state management.
 - You are using BEM-style class names for styling.

 ðŸŸ¡ Mistakes & Tripping Points to Watch For:
 1. **Array Indexing After Splice:**
    - When you splice or modify an array inside a loop, the indices can shift. This can cause you to skip items or access undefined values.
    - Solution: Consider looping backwards when removing items, or always save the object to move before splicing.

 2. **Accessing Properties on Arrays Instead of Objects:**
    - Example: `completedHabitArray.name` is undefined; you need `completedHabitArray[i].name`.

 3. **Clearing Lists in Event Handlers:**
    - You sometimes clear lists (`innerHTML = ""`) inside button handlers. Let your render functions handle this.

 5. **Date Formatting:**
    - You sometimes store/display the full ISO string. Use `.toISOString().split('T')[0]` for `YYYY-MM-DD` or `.toLocaleDateString()` for a user-friendly format.

 6. **Class Naming:**
    - Make sure each element gets a unique, descriptive class for styling and clarity.

 7. **Global Variables:**
    - Avoid defining objects (like `habitObj`) globally. Always create new objects inside event handlers to prevent reference bugs.

 8. **UI/UX:**
    - Consider adding visual feedback for actions (e.g., animations, color changes on complete/delete).

 ðŸŸ  What You're Missing (from your original MD/project goals):
 - **API/Database Integration:** You said you'll skip localStorage and use an API/database. You need to:
     - Replace all array manipulations with API calls (fetch, POST, DELETE, etc.).
     - Update your UI after each API response.
     - Handle loading states and errors from the API.
 - **Dynamic Rendering from API:** On page load, fetch habits from your backend and render them.
 - **Authentication (optional):** If your API/database is user-specific, you'll need to handle auth (login, tokens, etc.).
 - **Validation:** Prevent duplicate habits, empty names, etc.
 - **Accessibility:** Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus states for better UX.

 ðŸŸ£ Next Steps for API Practice:
 1. Replace all direct array pushes/splices with API requests (using `fetch` or `axios`).
 2. On success, update your arrays and re-render the UI.
 3. On page load, fetch all habits from the API and populate your arrays/UI.
 4. Handle errors gracefully (show a message if the API fails).
